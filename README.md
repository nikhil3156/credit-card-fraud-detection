# credit-card-fraud-detection
A machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. The model uses classification algorithms to predict whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent, helping banks and businesses reduce financial losses.
Dataset

Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Description: The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions, with features representing transaction details. The Class column is the target variable:

0 → Legitimate transaction

1 → Fraudulent transaction

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables if needed.

Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features from existing data (optional).

Model Training: Tested multiple classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Techniques like SMOTE or class weighting were used.

Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Optional: XGBoost, LightGBM

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-link>


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud.ipynb

Results

Model achieves X% accuracy and Y% recall for fraud detection (replace with your metrics).

Confusion matrix and ROC curve included in the notebook.

Future Improvements

Test with deep learning models (e.g., neural networks).

Incorporate real-time transaction data.

Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
